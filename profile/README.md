Avaota SBC is committed to promoting an open-source ecosystem of hardware and software integration, providing entry-level to high-performance open-source single-board computers (SBCs). All hardware designs are implemented using the CERN-OHL-S open-source license.

Additionally, we offer AvaotaOS, an OS distribution based on Ubuntu, along with corresponding interface functions, libraries, usage examples, facilitating entry-level development and agile development.

All hardware designs use easyeda: https://pro.easyeda.com/editor
